                <p>We chose Turkana, a region in remote north-western Kenya, bordering Ethiopia, South Sudan and Uganda as a starting point for our program.<br> The region suffers from poor infrastructure and very few job opportunities <br> if the model works here, it could work anywhere.<br>
                The countyâ€™s semi-arid climate makes sustainable agriculture very difficult,<br> so that the majority of food supplies have to be transported from regions several hours away.<br> Most of its population still follow traditional pastoral living habits in relatively poor conditions.<br> Local businesses include basket weaving, mechanical repairs and small kiosks, however none of these scale to provide widespread employment opportunities or meaningful wages.<br> The youth are the most directly affected, having little opportunity to find a job and move beyond subsistence livelihoods in their home region. And yet, with around 1 million inhabitants<br> Turkana holds an untapped potential of human talent with the great opportunity of internet access even in some of the most remote areas.</p>
